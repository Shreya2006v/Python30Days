ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my 30-day Python learning journey!  I've built a strong foundation in core concepts, and I'm now transitioning into hands-on practice by working on a series of mini projects. These projects will help reinforce what I've learned and allow me to explore real-world applications. Looking forward to growing further and sharing my progress ahead!

        >> For further information regarding my projects, feel free to explore each one in its folders in same repository. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey and growing as a developer!ðŸ˜Ž
